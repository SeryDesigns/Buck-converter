# Buck converter

## Project status 
Manufactured, assembled, not tested yet

## Project overview

Small synchronous buck converter PCB that can be used for small projects, the converter is based on RT6222D IC.
The input voltage can range from 4.3V to 18V, the output can be set between 0.6V to 8V.
The maximum output current is 2A though thermal dissipation should be taken into account.\
The switching frequancy of the converter is 1.4MHz.\
The IC has thermal protection in case it gets too hot, if junction temperature goes above 160°C it will shut down until the junction cools down by 20°C.

The dimension of the PCB are 33mm X 15mm, it is a 2 layers PCB with compoenents assembled only on the TOP layer
